# Self Evaluation

- What did you struggle with in this section?
*I struggled with printing out my email. Initially, I thought the error was what I was naming my key but I tried several different key names which gave me the same error.  After doing more research, I then realized I wasn't calling the key from my hash so that was the error I was getting. I had to string interpolate my variable to call it to my hash and within the string interpolation, call my key with square brackets (I think this is called bracket notation?). Once I completed that, I was able to print out my email.*

- How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?
*I do well with taking hand written notes and this has been working for me. I like using different colors to make words stand out. I take the best notes while reading through the lesson plan. If I have to jot something down quickly during class, I do so on a rough piece of paper then write it down nicely (with different colors) after class in my notebook. Though this takes a bit more time, it helps me review what was learned as well*

- What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?
*I usually try figuring out a problem in code for about 10-15minutes before I use Google. I talk out the problem to myself and try to see if I am missing anything simple. During this time, I also refer to my notes. If I cannot find the problem from there, I will then refer to Google; although, I've noticed that Googling solutions is not as easy it seems.  I definitely need to work on "what to type" in Google in order to get the answers I need.*
